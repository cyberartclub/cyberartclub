- 👋 Hi, I’m Renée @cyberartclub and I'm not the best at these profile intros, so I'll be using the default template for now!
- 👀 I’m interested in digital media, communications tech, video games, sunbathing strategies, and historical analysis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VR game development in Unreal and 3D modelling in Blender.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make others' lives better <3
- 📫 How to reach me > thecyberartclub@gmail.com for now :)
